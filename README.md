# Json .Net for Unity
This repository is just a clone in github from the official FREE project in Unity asset store in order to use it as submodule

The codes are provided as-they-are, unchanged from the official project,

If you need the latest updates, you can also install the plugin using the
[official Asset Store plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347)

Licensed just like the official project is.
